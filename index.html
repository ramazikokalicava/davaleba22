    <h3><s>What is Lorem Ipsum?</s></h3>

    <p> <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br><i>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br> essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <u><mark>1960s</mark></u> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of</i>  <strong>Lorem Ipsum.</strong> .</p>
    <p><strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't <br> look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</strong> <q><strong>All the <br> Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet</strong></q>. <strong> It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br> Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. <i>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free <br> from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</i></strong> </p>
